This is my submission for Project 4: Interactive Photo Gallery. I received an Exceeds Expectations grade for this project.

In this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos were provided with descriptions. At the top of the page is a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox with back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.
